Things I did


Capstone: Protein Sequence Selection via Deep Learning
======
Selecting optimal proteins for experimentation is a manual and time-consuming task.
Here, working closely with the client, I engineered a solution leveraging recent advances in natural language processing to help predict these proteins.
My role was to engineer data, develop a model, and integrated it with GUI.

GymBud Project
======
Studies show that velocity-based training is highly effective.
It is based on the idea that the speed of movement is related to the intensity of the exercise.
However, current devices that track exercise movement cost upwards of 300 USD to 2000 USD, making it unaffordable for many.
Here, I led a team of 4 to prototype a similar device at a fraction of the cost in order to improve accessibility to this training method.

QEC QAE Paper Implementation (In progress)
------
Currently Quantum Error correction requires at least 5 qubits to correct bitflip and phase flip errors

I aimed to reproduce the results in the paper "Quantum Error Correction with Quantum Autoencoders".

In this paper, the author used a 5 to 1 to 5 autoencoder network to detect and correct errors.

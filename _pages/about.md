Throughout my academic career, I have developed excellent analytical skills.
I can absorb complex information quickly and effectively apply it to solve problems and make informed decisions.


The purpose of this website is to showcase my projects


# Education

A major challenge to successful protein experiments, which are used to develop novel drugs, is selecting the most viable protein fragments.

My capstone team worked closely with our client, Gandeeva, to develop a solution to solve this challenge leveraging recent advances in natural language processing.

My role was to engineer data, develop a model, and integrated it with a user interface.

There was a constant need to re-prioritize when new information came up in order to fit the project into an eight-month timeline.  This experience will help me participate in designing, implementing, testing, and optimizing solutions.

Studies have shown that using devices to track key metrics when exercising can help improve exercise quality. In particular, tracking the velocity of movements during resistance training has proven effective. However, such devices cost hundreds of dollars, making them unaffordable for many. In this project, I led a team of four to prototype a similar device at a fraction of the cost in order to improve the accessibility of this training tool.

<p style="font-size: 14px">
For this project, I led the meetings, managed the project scope, and steered the direction.
I implemented the backend database and data processing for the sensor.
The outcome was a successfully integrated system with minimal redesign needed.

# Taking a deep dive into significant research papers
I repeated recent significant scientific studies to replicate the results in order to better understand the discovery process and deepen my knowledge of machine learning and quantum computing.


### Research paper reproduction “Generative Adversarial Nets” Paper 
##### Timeline: 4 Months. Written in Python, Pytorch.

Below shows the iterations of the model I created in action.

Below shows a comparison of the real images inputted and the images generated.

<p style="font-size: 14px">
This was an early paper that explored one approach of creating computer-generated images using only existing images as a starting point.

To replicate the methods in this paper, I first researched background knowledge in this area of machine learning. Then I reviewed similar existing implementations and adapted them to my use case. I gave images of handwritten digits to train the model. The goal was for the program to produce new digits that looked indistinguishable from the real images inputted.

Completing this project required extensive research into industry best practices.

### Research paper reproduction “Quantum Error Correction with Quantum Autoencoders” Paper 
##### Timeline: 4 Months. Written in Python, Pytorch.  (In progress)

<p style="font-size: 14px">
Autoencoders are computer programs that can learn how to compress and decompress information. 
In this paper, the author implements this technique on simulated quantum hardware to “compress” quantum states, 
simulate error occurrences, then “decompress” them to their original unaltered states.

Currently Quantum Error correction requires at least 5 qubits to correct bitflip and phase flip errors
I aimed to reproduce the results in the paper "Quantum Error Correction with Quantum Autoencoders".
In this paper, the author used a 5 to 1 to 5 autoencoder network to detect and correct errors.
